# Heirlooms — Version History

---

## v0.8.0 — Large file upload via GCS signed URLs (6 May 2026)

Fixes the 34 MB+ video upload failure (Cloud Run enforces a hard 32 MB request
body limit that cannot be configured away).

Three-step upload flow in HeirloomsApp:
1. `POST /api/content/uploads/prepare` → server returns a signed GCS PUT URL (15-min expiry)
2. Mobile app PUTs file bytes **directly to GCS** — Cloud Run is bypassed entirely
3. `POST /api/content/uploads/confirm` → server records metadata in the database

- `DirectUploadSupport` interface + `PreparedUpload` data class added to HeirloomsServer
- `GcsFileStore` implements `DirectUploadSupport`; uses `ServiceAccountCredentials`
  (already in `GCS_CREDENTIALS_JSON`) for V4 URL signing — no new secrets needed
- Prepare endpoint returns 501 for non-GCS backends (local, S3)
- `Uploader.uploadViaSigned()` added to HeirloomsApp; `ShareActivity` now always
  uses this path; OkHttp write timeout raised to 300s
- Validated end-to-end: 34.57 MB video uploaded successfully

## v0.7.0 — Web gallery UI (6 May 2026)

Milestone 4 complete. Adds HeirloomsWeb and a file retrieval endpoint.

- `GET /api/content/uploads/{id}/file` — new HeirloomsServer endpoint; looks up
  the upload record by UUID, fetches the file from GCS, streams it back with the
  correct `Content-Type`; returns 404 if not found
- `FileStore.get(key)` — new method on the interface, implemented in
  `LocalFileStore`, `S3FileStore`, and `GcsFileStore`
- `uploadedAt` added to `UploadRecord` and the list endpoint JSON response
- CORS support added to HeirloomsServer (all origins; tighten when domain is live);
  OPTIONS preflight answered before `ApiKeyFilter` runs
- `HeirloomsWeb/` — new React 18 + Tailwind CSS + Vite sub-project; gallery grid
  with image thumbnails (blob URL fetch so `X-Api-Key` header can be sent), file
  icons for non-images, upload date, MIME type, file size; lightbox on click;
  in-session API key login (React state only — cleared on every page reload);
  multi-stage Dockerfile (Node 22 → nginx:alpine)

## v0.6.0 — Swagger UI + API key auth in docs (5 May 2026)

- Swagger UI integrated and validated on Cloud Run
- API key auth surfaced in Swagger UI (`X-Api-Key` header scheme)
- `persistAuthorization: true` so the key survives page refresh in the docs UI

---

## v0.5.0 — GCS backend + Cloud Run deployment (2–4 May 2026)

- `GcsFileStore` — Google Cloud Storage backend; credentials from
  `GCS_CREDENTIALS_JSON` env var (never written to disk)
- Cloud SQL PostgreSQL socket factory for Cloud Run → Cloud SQL connectivity
- API key authentication added to HeirloomsServer (`ApiKeyFilter`) and
  HeirloomsApp (settings screen + `X-Api-Key` header on uploads)
- Full GCP infrastructure provisioned: Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, GCS bucket,
  Artifact Registry, service account with least-privilege IAM, secrets in
  Secret Manager

## v0.4.0 — Self-hosted deployment (1 May 2026)

Milestone 3 complete. Adds a `deploy/` folder so the full stack can be run on a
home server or cheap VPS with a single command.

- `deploy/docker-compose.yml` — production compose with named volumes, host port
  binding (8080:8080), restart policies, and a `build:` directive that compiles
  HeirloomsServer from source
- `deploy/.env.example` — credential template; real `.env` is gitignored
- `deploy/README.md` — step-by-step setup guide for a VPS or home server

Key differences from the test compose: credentials from `.env` (not hardcoded),
named volumes so data survives restarts, `restart: unless-stopped` on all services.

---

## v0.3.0 — Package rename + docs (30 April 2026)

Administrative release following domain registration (`heirlooms.digital`).

- Renamed package `com.heirloom` → `digital.heirlooms` across all 22 Kotlin source
  files in HeirloomsApp, HeirloomsServer, and HeirloomsTest
- Added `TEAM.md`, `PA_NOTES.md`, `SE_NOTES.md`, `PROMPT_LOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md`
- Reorganised all docs into `docs/`; updated `README.md` with a doc index

---

## v0.2.0 — Backend server + integration tests (30 April 2026)

Milestone 2 complete. Adds HeirloomsServer and HeirloomsTest.

**HeirloomsServer** — Kotlin/http4k server with three endpoints:
- `POST /api/content/upload` — receives file bytes, stores to MinIO, records
  metadata in PostgreSQL, returns storage key
- `GET /api/content/uploads` — returns JSON array of all uploads
- `GET /health` — liveness check

Stack: http4k + Netty, PostgreSQL + HikariCP + Flyway, AWS SDK v2 S3 client
(with `forcePathStyle` for MinIO compatibility). Runs in Docker via a multi-stage
Dockerfile using Eclipse Temurin 21.

**HeirloomsTest** — Gradle integration test project using Testcontainers 2.x and
OkHttp. Spins up the full Docker Compose stack (postgres, minio, minio-init,
heirloom-server) and runs 10 tests across two test classes: upload API tests and
end-to-end journey tests. All tests passing.

## v0.1.0 — Android share-target app (30 April 2026)

Milestone 1 complete. Adds HeirloomsApp.

An Android app (Kotlin) that registers as a share target for `image/*` and
`video/*`. When a photo or video is shared to Heirlooms, it HTTP POSTs the file
to a configurable endpoint with the correct `Content-Type`. A settings screen
(accessible from the share sheet) lets the endpoint URL be changed without
editing config files. Endpoint stored in `SharedPreferences`. Sideloaded in
developer mode — no app store required.

Originally written in Java; rewritten in Kotlin with the settings screen added
in the same session.
