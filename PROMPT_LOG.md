# Heirlooms — Prompt Log

A record of the key decisions and prompts from the founding development session
(April 2026). Each entry captures the original intent, what was built, and any
important context or tradeoffs discovered along the way.

---

## Phase 1 — Product brainstorm

**Prompt:** "Hi Claude! I'm new here. Could you brainstorm creative concepts?"
Chose: "A project or product" / "I have a rough idea — help me expand it"

**What happened:** A brainstorm around digital legacy and inheritance. Eight concept
cards were generated covering the digital safe, dead man's switch, digital estate
planner, memory book, time-locked messages, collective memory space, digital rights
passport, and digital executor service.

---

**Prompt:** "Tell me more about concept: a personal digital vault app where people
can organise their photos, videos, and messages into a time-capsule-style legacy
that gets unlocked for next of kin."

**What happened:** A detailed breakdown of how the vault would work in two phases
(building the vault while alive; the unlock after death), a feature comparison
against cloud storage, a UI sketch, and an analysis of key challenges. The milestone
delivery mechanic — a video arriving on a child's 18th birthday — was identified as
the single most powerful differentiator.

---

## Phase 2 — Android app (v1, Java)

**Prompt:** "I'd like to start off by creating an Android app, just for me.
When I use the universal Android 'share with' function for any image or video,
I can choose 'Share with APPLICATION_NAME'. The application simply does a HTTP POST
to AN_ENDPOINT with the video/photo contents as the body. Content-Type should reflect
the file type. APPLICATION_NAME and AN_ENDPOINT are configurable in application
properties. I should be able to build the project using Gradle."

**What was built:** A complete Android project in Java. `ShareActivity` registers as
a share target for `image/*` and `video/*`, reads the file via `ContentResolver`,
and HTTP POSTs it using OkHttp. App name and endpoint configured via
`assets/config.properties`. Transparent activity theme so no UI flash appears.

---

**Prompt:** "I have Android Studio installed and I've opened the folder but when I
Build → Make Project I see the error... [missing gradle-wrapper.jar]"

**Decision:** Added `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` to the project and added a
`run-tests.sh` script that auto-downloads it if missing, so the project works without
Android Studio being involved in the build setup.

---

## Phase 3 — Kotlin rewrite + settings screen

**Prompt:** "Could we use Kotlin rather than Java for this Android project?"

**What was built:** Full rewrite of the Android app in Kotlin. Split into four files:
`ShareActivity.kt`, `Uploader.kt`, `EndpointStore.kt`, and `SettingsActivity.kt`.
Added a settings screen accessible from the share sheet so the endpoint URL can be
changed without editing config files. Endpoint stored in `SharedPreferences`.

---

## Phase 4 — Backend server (HeirloomsServer)

**Prompt:** "Could we now look at the server side? I'd like to look at what we need
to do in order to have a very simple server, that the android app could post images
or videos to, that would store them."

**Decision:** Kotlin/http4k server chosen over Spring Boot for minimal footprint.
PostgreSQL for metadata, MinIO (S3-compatible) for file storage. Flyway for database
migrations. HikariCP connection pool. AWS SDK v2 S3 async client with
`forcePathStyle(true)` for MinIO compatibility.

**What was built:** `HeirloomsServer` with four endpoints:
- `POST /api/content/upload` — receives file bytes, stores to S3/MinIO, records
  metadata in PostgreSQL, returns storage key
- `GET /api/content/uploads` — returns JSON array of all uploads
- `GET /health` — returns 200 "ok"

`AppConfig` reads from `application.properties` locally or directly from environment
variables (by exact uppercase name: `DB_URL`, `S3_ACCESS_KEY` etc.) when running in
Docker. The env var approach was fixed after an early bug where underscores were
converted to dots (`S3_ACCESS_KEY` → `s3.access.key`) but the property lookup used
hyphens (`s3.access-key`), causing silent config failure.

---

## Phase 5 — Docker + end-to-end tests (HeirloomsTest)

**Prompt:** "I wonder if we might want a third 'project' within Heirloom that runs
integration tests against the server."

**What was built:** `HeirloomsTest` — a Gradle project using Testcontainers and OkHttp
that spins up the full Docker Compose stack (PostgreSQL, MinIO, minio-init, HeirloomsServer)
and runs API tests and journey tests against it.

**Key decisions:**
- Testcontainers 2.0.5 chosen over 1.x because Docker Engine 29.x raised its minimum
  API version to 1.40, and docker-java (used by Testcontainers 1.x) hardcoded API
  version 1.32, making it incompatible. Testcontainers 2.x handles API negotiation
  correctly.
- Playwright removed from journey tests because Chromium cannot reach the Testcontainers
  socat proxy port from its sandboxed process. All journey tests use OkHttp instead.
- Shadow plugin (8.1.1) with `mergeServiceFiles()` used instead of a hand-rolled fat
  JAR task. The original `DuplicatesStrategy.EXCLUDE` approach silently dropped
  `META-INF/services/org.flywaydb.core.extensibility.Plugin`, which prevented the
  Flyway PostgreSQL plugin from registering, causing "relation uploads does not exist"
  errors even though the migration file was present and correctly named.

---

## Key bugs fixed during HeirloomsTest development

**Docker socket on macOS** — `/var/run/docker.sock` and `~/.docker/run/docker.sock`
return stub 400 responses on macOS Docker Desktop. The working socket is at
`~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/docker.raw.sock`. Fixed by auto-detecting
socket candidates in `HeirloomsTestEnvironment` and setting `DOCKER_HOST` accordingly.

**Ryuk failing before test code** — Ryuk's static initialiser fires before any test
code runs and fails independently. Fixed by `ryuk.disabled=true` in
`~/.testcontainers.properties`.

**Testcontainers 2.x API changes** — `withLocalCompose()` was removed (local compose
is now the default); `junit-jupiter` artifact renamed to `testcontainers-junit-jupiter`.

**`AppConfig.fromEnv()` hyphen vs dot mismatch** — see Phase 4 above.

**Flyway "0 migrations applied"** — `DuplicatesStrategy.EXCLUDE` silently dropped the
Flyway service registration file. Fixed by switching to Shadow plugin with
`mergeServiceFiles()`.

**`docker-compose.yml` port format** — Testcontainers 2.x requires ports declared as
`"8080"` (no host binding) rather than `"8080:8080"` so it can manage port mapping
via its socat ambassador container.

**`version:` field in docker-compose.yml** — removed as it is obsolete in Compose V2
and was generating warnings.

**GRADLE_OPTS native crash** — `GRADLE_OPTS="-Dorg.gradle.native=false"` added
throughout Docker builds to prevent a SIGSEGV crash of `libnative-platform-file-events.so`
on Apple Silicon (ARM64).

## One-time machine setup

```
~/.testcontainers.properties

docker.host=unix:///Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/docker.raw.sock
testcontainers.reuse.enable=false
ryuk.disabled=true
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your macOS username. This is the only persistent
machine-level configuration required. Everything else is self-contained in the repo.

---

## Final state

**10 tests passing** across two test classes:

`UploadApiTest`: health check, POST image returns 201, POST video returns 201, POST
without Content-Type returns 201, POST empty body returns 400, GET uploads returns
JSON array, uploaded file appears in listing.

`UploadJourneyTest`: upload and verify in listing, multi-type upload journey,
health endpoint reachable.

Build time on a warm cache (Docker layers cached): under 20 seconds.
Build time on a cold cache (first run): 3–5 minutes for dependency downloads.

---

## Domain registration

**Date:** 30 April 2026

`heirlooms.digital` registered. Several names were considered during this session:

- `digital-legacy.com` — available but too generic
- `heirloom.digital` — strong first choice, but misspelled as "hierloom" on first
  attempt (fat fingers)
- `heirloom.co.uk` — correct spelling but country-locked
- `heirlooms.digital` — chosen: plural feels warmer ("a collection" rather than
  "a single object"), .digital is thematically appropriate, not country-locked
- `heirlooms.com` — parked on venture.com, potentially acquirable in future if the
  project grows to warrant it

The project name was updated from **Heirloom** to **Heirlooms** to match the domain.
The rename is the first task queued for the next development session.

---

## Session — 30 April 2026 (v0.3.0 polish + package rename)

**Fix: `Uploader.kt` compile error**

`IntRange` implements `Iterable`, not `Sequence`, so calling `.zip(Sequence)` on it
failed to compile. Fixed by inserting `.asSequence()` before `.zip()`.

---

**Tag: v0.3.0**

Annotated git tag `v0.3.0` created on `main` to mark the state of the project at the
end of the founding development session.

---

**Package rename: `com.heirloom` → `digital.heirlooms`**

Queued at the end of the previous session to align with the `heirlooms.digital` domain.
Completed across all three subprojects — 22 Kotlin source files, 3 `build.gradle.kts`
files, and the corresponding source directory layout:

- `HeirloomsApp`: `com/heirloom/app/` → `digital/heirlooms/app/`
- `HeirloomsServer`: `com/heirloom/server/` → `digital/heirlooms/server/`
- `HeirloomsTest`: `com/heirloom/test/` → `digital/heirlooms/test/`

---

**TEAM.md added**

Documents the team structure: Bret Adam Calvey as Founder & CTO, the PA (claude.ai)
for strategic/architectural thinking, and the Software Engineer (Claude Code in
IntelliJ) for hands-on implementation. Establishes that the Software Engineer commits
but Bret always does the final push.

---

**PA_NOTES.md added**

The PA's (claude.ai) working memory file, committed to the repo so it persists across
sessions and is visible to all team members. Captures Bret's preferences and working
style, project facts to always remember, pending decisions, known gotchas, and team
reminders.

---

**SE_NOTES.md added**

The Software Engineer's (Claude Code) own working memory file. Covers how to get
session context, commit conventions, project structure at a glance, and code-level
things worth remembering between sessions.

---

**docs/chats/2026-04-30-initial-chat.md added**

The original claude.ai founding session chat, formatted as markdown. 356 turns
spanning 24–30 April 2026. Converted from `Original_chat.txt` (now removed):
day-separated sections, `**Human**` / `**Claude**` blocks, action/tool lines
stripped, duplicate lines deduplicated.
